## Project Description

DailySchedule is a modern, intelligent daily planner web application designed to help users optimize their time management. The application allows users to:

- Plan tasks with estimated durations
- Track actual time spent on activities
- Analyze time management patterns
- Improve productivity through data-driven insights

## Key Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and remove daily activities
- **Time Tracking**: Compare planned vs. actual time spent
- **Performance Analysis**: Visual indicators for on-time, early, or delayed tasks
- **Priority System**: Categorize tasks by importance (low, medium, high)
- **Day Filtering**: Organize tasks by day of the week
- **Local Storage**: All data persists in the browser
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Modern UI**: Sleek dark theme with gradient accents

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS variables for theming)
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Bootstrap 5 (for responsive layout and components)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- Google Fonts (Poppins, Montserrat, Dancing Script)

## Color Scheme

The application uses a modern dark theme with purple/pink accents:

- Primary: `#6C63FF` (Purple)
- Secondary: `#FF6584` (Pink)
- Accent: `#FFC107` (Amber)
- Dark Background: `#0F172A` (Dark Navy)
- Card Background: `#1E293B` (Lighter Navy)

## Application Structure

1. **Navigation Bar**: Fixed at top with logo and main sections
2. **Hero Section**: Main call-to-action with task input form
3. **Activity List**: Shows all scheduled tasks with time analysis
4. **Features Section**: Highlights application benefits
5. **Footer**: Copyright and social links

## Installation

No installation required - this is a client-side web application that runs directly in the browser. Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser.

## How to Use

1. **Add a Task**:
   - Fill in the task name
   - Enter planned and actual time (in minutes)
   - Select day of week
   - Set priority level
   - Add optional action steps and notes
   - Click "Add to Schedule"

2. **View Tasks**:
   - All tasks appear in the "My Schedule" section
   - Color-coded borders indicate performance (green=on time, yellow=early, red=delayed)

3. **Filter Tasks**:
   - Use the filter dropdown to view only on-time, early, or delayed tasks

4. **Delete Tasks**:
   - Click the "Remove" button on any task to delete it

## Data Persistence

All tasks are saved to the browser's localStorage, so they persist between sessions. No data is sent to any external servers.

## Future Enhancements

- User accounts with cloud synchronization
- Calendar view for tasks
- Time tracking visualization charts
- Mobile app versions
- Sharing/exporting schedules
- Recurring tasks functionality
